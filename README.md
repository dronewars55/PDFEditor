# PDFEdition
A class library for the simplification of certain actions such as adding text to a PDF file or filling in a PDF form using 
iTextSharp

This is a class I constructed to make my life easier during a project in which I had to manipulate a PDF file for some simple
tasks. 

It is able to add some text on top of an existing PDF file and manipulate the text fields in a PDF form in such ways as creating new ones, editing their content and flattening them. Nothing more, nothing less.

Not the most polished in the world but does the job as intended. It depends on iTextSharp which can be found as a
NuGet repository.
